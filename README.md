## Description

The Bürkert Communicator is the most important software component of the 'Efficient Device Integration Platform' (EDIP). Various features of this universal tool simplify the configuration and parameterization of devices equipped with a digital CANopen based interface. With this tool the user has a complete overview of cyclic process values as well as acyclic diagnosis data. In the near future, an integral part of the Communicator will be a graphical programming environment which will help in creating decentralized sub-system control functions. The connection to the PC is established with a USB-CAN adapter.

* Configuration, parameterisation and diagnosis of EDIP devices / networks
* Easy and comfortable mapping of cyclic values
* Graphical display of process values
* Firmware updates for devices
* Backup and restoring of device configurations
